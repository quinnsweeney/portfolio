            Hi, I'm Quinn! I grew up in Denver, Colorado and am currently an
            undergraduate student at the University of Alabama majoring in MIS
            with a minor in Computer Science. I love to ski, watch sports, and
            solve challenging problems. <br /> <br />
            I've been fascinated with computers for my entire life, and it lead
            me to teach myself how to code at a relatively young age. From there
            I got an apprenticeship doing web development at Pinnacol Assurance
            - the largest workers compensation insurance company in Colorado. I
            won't bore you with the details, but my passion for coding led me
            down a long path of challenges and success stories to get where I am
            today.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm currently working on some projects to beefen up my portfolio, as
            well as applying to internships for next summer.{" "}
